                    I eagerly took on programming assignments for my group of friends and sought every opportunity to write code, 
                    primarily using MATLAB and Python. This drive carried me through to graduating top of my class in 2020 (virtually because of COVID-19).

                    eagerly tackling coding challenges right away. At HP Inc., I was able to build upon work I did in 
                    the Medically Advanced Devices Lab at UC San Diego—developing a computer vision program with Java 
                    and Python to help analyze microfluidic research videos much more accurately than engineers were
                    doing before.

                    Driven by a passion for problem-solving and continuous learning, I transitioned fully into software
                    engineering. Despite not having a traditional computer science degree, I leveraged online resources
                    to bridge the gap and accelerate my growth. At Boeing I primarily developed communication satellite
                    flight software in C++, managed and configured Linux scripts and environments, and created Python
                    tools to automate different processes.My journey so far reflects a lifelong passion for building,
                    innovating, and transforming abstract ideas into tangible solutions—one line of code at a time.
